# AIChatbot
after I downloaded llama3.1 and deepSeek-r1 locally , i use these LLMs to create local chatbot and integrated them(since they are pretrained). I used Ollama to download those models(you can even run directly from your terminal). I also used Langchain and Gradio  for a better UI experience.
